1)  Find and slice. Use find and string slicing to extract the portion of the string after the colon character and then use the float function to convert the extracted string into a floating point number.

    In the second cell below, generalize this algorithm. It should loop through the three strings provided in input and ensure that there is a ":" before extracting, converting and printing the number.

```{python}
# Here we create the algorithm for a single input
string = 'X-DSPAM-Confidence:0.8475'

if ":" in string :
    pos = string.find(":")
    number = float(string[pos+1: ])
    print(number)
else: 
    print("We could not find the ':' symbol")
```

```{python}
# Here we generalize and replicate the above program for a list of strings in input
strings = ['X-DSPAM-Confidence:0.8475', 'no colon here', 'X-DSPAM-Confidence:0.345']

for string in strings :
    if ":" in string :
        pos = string.find(":")
        number = float(string[pos+1: ])
        print(number)
    else: 
        print("We could not find the ':' symbol")
```

2)  Create a program that, collects user input until the user types "done".

    Given any string in input will first check for the length of the string. If the string in less than 5 characters long, it prints the message "Can't do anything with such a short string, try harder!"

    When the string is longer than 5 character, then the program will slice the string and only extract the middle five characters.

```{python}
# Collect first input and start the loop
inp = input('Please, enter some text. Type "done" to stop: ')

while inp != 'done' :
    string_length = len(inp)
    if string_length > 4 :
        starting = string_length // 2 - 2
        print(inp[starting : starting + 5])
    else:
        # We use the escape character \ within the string for illustration pursposes
        # Alternatively we could have simply used double quotes for the string:
        # print("Can't do anything with such a short string, try harder!")
        print('Can\'t do anything with such a short string, try harder!')
        
    inp = input('Please, enter some text. Type "done" to stop: ')
    
print('Thanks for playing with us!')
```

3)  Create a program that, collects user input until the user types "done".

    For each string in input, first, strip any white space at the beginning or the end of the string. Then delete all the vowels from the string and print the resulting string.

```{python}
# Collect first input and start the loop
inp = input('Please, enter some text. Type "done" to stop: ')

while inp != 'done' :
    text = inp.strip()
    for vowel in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'] :
        text = text.replace(vowel, "")

    print('Your input string with no vowels is: ', text)
    inp = input('Please, enter some text. Type "done" to stop: ')
    
print('Thanks for playing with us!')
```

## Challenge

Write a program that uses the skills you develped to this point, with particular attention to string manipulation. The task is to write a program that will compute the total amount a guest should pay by parsing an arbitrary restaurant check. The check, extracted from a point of sale, comes to you as a string with items, categories and amounts. You should extract the appropriate data and compute the sum total of what the guest spent.

Since the data comes from a system, a Poing of Sale, you can be sure that its structure is fixed. You should ensure that your code works for a typical check, using the following sample:

`data = 'chicken food$12.50;burger food$10.50;beer drink$5.00;wine drink$6.50'`

You should then make sure your code generalizes to the following test cases:

`data = 'chicken food$12.50;burger food$10.50;beer drink$5.00;wine drink$6.50;soda drink$2.50;poke food$14.30'`

`data = 'chicken food$12.50'`

`data = ''`

# Write your code here

# Challenge 1 - String extraction

data = 'chicken food\$12.50;burger food\$10.50;beer drink\$5.00;wine drink\$6.50' #data = 'chicken food\$12.50;burger food\$10.50;beer drink\$5.00;wine drink\$6.50;soda drink\$2.50;poke food\$14.30' #data = 'chicken food\$12.50' #data = ''

def extractor(input_string): dollar_pos = data.find("\$") semi_pos = data.find(";") if semi_pos == -1: number = input_string\[dollar_pos + 1 : \] output_string = "done" else: number = input_string\[dollar_pos + 1 : semi_pos\] output_string = input_string\[semi_pos + 1 : \] number = float(number) return number, output_string

total = 0 if data == '': print('Nothing was ordered') else: while data != "done": value, data = extractor(data) total += value print('The total check value is: \$', total)
