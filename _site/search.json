    "text": "Title Fixer: You receive a list of messy book titles like [“tHe gReaT GaTsBy”, “cAtcHer in the rYe”]. Write a function that returns each title with only the first letter capitalized and the rest in lowercase.\n\nTip: Use str.capitalize()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentered Banner Generator: Create a function that takes a word and prints it as a banner, centered in a width of 30 using * as the fill character.\n\nTip: Use str.center(width[, fillchar])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Filter: Given a list of filenames, print only those that end with .jpg or .png with an appropriate message.\n\nTip: Use str.endswith(suffix[, start[, end]])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClean-Up on the Left: You’re given strings like \"---Warning!\" or \"***Important Notice\". Strip out all leading special characters (-, *, etc.) and return the cleaned string.\n\nTip: Use str.lstrip([chars])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCensorship Machine: Censor any inappropriate words in a user input string (e.g., replace \"darn\" with \"****\"). Optionally, only replace the first occurrence.\n\nTip: Use str.replace(old, new[, count])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLetter counter: A secret message is sent with random capitalizations by the zodiac killer. You need to count the number of “k” and “m” (for kill and murder) in the text. It does not matter if they are capitalized or not, any occurrence of the letter needs to be counted. Use the functions you deem best for the job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShouting Bot: Make a function that takes a sentence and “shouts” it in all caps, adding three exclamation points at the end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind and slice. Use find and string slicing to extract the portion of the string after the colon character and then use the float function to convert the extracted string into a floating point number.\nIn the second cell below, generalize this algorithm. It should loop through the three strings provided in input and ensure that there is a “:” before extracting, converting and printing the number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMiddle five slicer: Create a program that, collects user input until the user types “done”.\nGiven any string in input will first check for the length of the string. If the string in less than 5 characters long, it prints the message “Can’t do anything with such a short string, try harder!”\nWhen the string is longer than 5 character, then the program will slice the string and only extract the middle five characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVowels delete: Create a program that, collects user input until the user types “done”.\nFor each string in input, first, strip any white space at the beginning or the end of the string. Then delete all the vowels from the string and print the resulting string.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCount Vowels in a String Create a function count_vowels(text) that counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a given string. Use a for loop and conditional statements to accomplish the task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassword Strength Checker Write a function check_password_strength(password) that evaluates a password. Then test it on three passwords of your choice. The rules are:\n\n\nIf it’s less than 6 characters → “Weak”\nIf it’s between 6-10 characters → “Moderate”\nIf it’s more than 10 characters → “Strong”"

The check, extracted from a point of sale, comes to you as a string with items, categories and amounts. You should extract the appropriate data and compute the sum total of what the guest spent.\nSince the data comes from a system, a Point of Sale, you can be sure that its structure is fixed. You should ensure that your code works for a typical check, using the following sample:\ndata = 'chicken food$12.50;burger food$10.50;beer drink$5.00;wine drink$6.50'\nYou should then make sure your code generalizes to the following test cases:\ndata = 'chicken food$12.50;burger food$10.50;beer drink$5.00;wine drink$6.50;soda drink$2.50;poke food$14.30'\ndata = 'chicken food$12.50'\ndata = ''\n\nWrite your code here"
